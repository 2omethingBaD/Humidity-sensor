# Enclsure humidity controller
Arduino code and circuit diagram for my snake's modified humidity controller. This project uses a temp and humidity sensor to mist the enclosure once the humidity drops below a certan percentage, this percentage along with the temprature in ferenheit and the misting motor status is displayed on an olde screen.

## The before
This project was made using parts form the humidity controller I was previously using. However, this device was timer based insted of being sensor based like I wanted.

The power cord, moter, and casing where thaken from this device.

## The circut 
The circuit is powered by 2 usb power cords (one to power the motor one for the microconntroller). along with the previously mentorned motor it also uses a TISEKER Mini Nano V3.0 ATmega328P Microcontroller Board, a dht22 temp and humidity sensor, a 0.96 Inch OLED dispaly, and an active buzzer to indicate power.

## The housing modifications
I decided to use the same casing the old device used since it alredy had propper cutouts and supports for the motor to fit into however, other modifications to fit the new components had to be made.
The first modification was made for the sensor so that it would be able to be placed inside of the enclosure while the main device is outside of it. This was done by burning a hole in the back of the plastic casing using an old saldering iron.

The secong modification was done using the same saldeing iron to burn away the old circut board's supports so that the new components could fit better.

The final modification was made for the olded screen, again using an old soldering iron a square mesured to the size of the screen was cut out.

## The finished product
Stickers where used to secure the screen in place and to clean up the desighn. The 2 usb power cords where plugged into a dule wall adaptor that was then plugged into a smart home plug so that the device could be controlled remotly.

The device was then re-hooked up to the enclosure itself where the sensor was run to a cutout in the back of the encluser and the inled and outlet for the water was hooked back up to the resivaour and misting spickets.
